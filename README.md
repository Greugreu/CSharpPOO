# CSharpPOO

Follow up of C# lessons and messing around

Now we get into serious things with OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

I commented my code if any wants to understand

* HelloPOO : Basic class method
* HelloPOO2 : Class creation
* HelloPOO3 : Class constructor, properties, encapsulation
* HelloPOO4 : Inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes
* TODO HelloPOO5 : Interfaces

Code is in CSharpPOO/HelloPOO/Program.cs

Tool used : JetBrains Rider
